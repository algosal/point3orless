Here's a step-by-step **technical implementation plan** for our project based on the architecture we want to build. We’ll prioritize components in a logical sequence to make the development process smoother, starting with foundational elements and gradually integrating more complex features.

---

### **Phase 1: Setting Up the Foundations**

1. **DynamoDB Setup (AWS)**

   - **Action**: Create a DynamoDB table to store registration data.
   - **Why**: This will serve as the initial database for user data registration and approval status.

2. **AWS Lambda Functions**

   - **Action**: Write Lambda functions to connect to DynamoDB via AWS API Gateway.
     - First Lambda function for user registration (creating new entries in DynamoDB).
     - Second Lambda function for login, validating users, and issuing JWTs.
   - **Why**: These serverless functions will handle user registration and authentication processes.

3. **Angular Frontend Setup**
   - **Action**: Initialize an Angular project and set up a basic service to handle API calls (user registration, login).
   - **Why**: This will serve as the UI for your users to register, log in, and view product information.

---

### **Phase 2: Authentication and User Management**

4. **JWT Authentication via AWS Lambda**

   - **Action**: Ensure the login Lambda issues a JWT for logged-in users.
   - **Why**: The JWT will be needed for secure access to restricted endpoints (like order creation and checkout).

5. **User Registration & Login in Angular**

   - **Action**: Develop Angular components for **Registration**, **Login**, and integrate with AWS Lambda API for user management.
   - **Why**: Frontend users will need these components to interact with your serverless backend.

6. **Angular Service for JWT Storage**
   - **Action**: Implement an Angular service to store the JWT and user information locally (e.g., local storage or session storage).
   - **Why**: JWT tokens are necessary for accessing the backend and ensuring secure communication between frontend and backend.

---

### **Phase 3: Backend Setup with Laravel**

7. **Laravel Installation & MySQL Configuration**

   - **Action**: Install Laravel on your HostGator server, connect it to your MySQL database.
   - **Why**: This will handle business logic such as product management, order processing, and pricing.

8. **User & Order Management APIs (Laravel)**
   - **Action**: Create Laravel APIs for:
     - Checking user approval status.
     - Handling order creation and modification.
     - Fetching user profile and order history.
   - **Why**: This will serve as the core of your backend logic, handling all the heavy lifting for product and order management.

---

### **Phase 4: Checkout Process**

9. **Order Calculation Logic in Laravel**

   - **Action**: Implement the business logic in Laravel to:
     - Check user status (approved/not approved).
     - Apply tax exemptions.
     - Ensure the minimum purchase amount is met.
   - **Why**: This ensures accurate order processing and that the correct price is calculated before payment.

10. **Square API Integration in Laravel**
    - **Action**: Integrate Square API in Laravel for payment processing.
    - **Why**: This will allow users to complete the payment securely, using Square as the payment processor.

---

### **Phase 5: AWS State Machine & Final Order Processing**

11. **AWS Lambda for Payment Finalization**

    - **Action**: Create an AWS Lambda function to finalize the payment after Square verification.
    - **Why**: This function will charge the user and confirm the order, sending back a confirmation to the Laravel API.

12. **AWS Step Functions (State Machine)**
    - **Action**: Use AWS Step Functions to coordinate the steps involved in order processing (e.g., charging the customer, sending confirmation, notifying admin/user).
    - **Why**: This will help streamline the payment and order notification process across multiple AWS services.

---

### **Phase 6: Admin and User Portals**

13. **Admin Portal in PHPRunner**

    - **Action**: Build an admin portal using **PHPRunner** for:
      - Managing user approval status.
      - Viewing and managing orders.
      - Controlling user account status (activation/inactivation).
    - **Why**: The admin portal is a key component to allow the business to manage users, monitor orders, and ensure smooth operations.

14. **User Portal in Angular**
    - **Action**: Develop a user dashboard in Angular for:
      - Viewing order history.
      - Updating profile and business approval information.
    - **Why**: The user portal is essential for customer self-service.

---

### **Phase 7: Notifications & Final Integrations**

15. **Email Notifications (AWS SES or Laravel Mail)**

    - **Action**: Set up email notifications for order confirmation and admin alerts via AWS SES or Laravel’s email feature.
    - **Why**: Both users and admins need to be informed about new orders and status updates.

16. **Final Testing & Security**
    - **Action**: Thoroughly test all API endpoints, security features (e.g., JWT authentication, admin roles), and ensure seamless integration between Angular, Laravel, AWS Lambda, and third-party services.
    - **Why**: Testing ensures your app is secure, functional, and performs well in real-world scenarios.

---

### **Phase 8: Deployment & Monitoring**

17. **Deployment & Hosting**

    - **Action**: Deploy Angular frontend on your preferred hosting service (e.g., AWS Amplify or Netlify).
    - **Action**: Ensure Laravel is properly deployed and configured on HostGator.
    - **Action**: Deploy the **PHPRunner Admin Panel** to HostGator or another suitable server environment.
    - **Why**: Deployment will make your application live for users and admins.

18. **Monitoring & Error Handling**
    - **Action**: Set up monitoring tools (e.g., CloudWatch for Lambda, Laravel logs) to track application performance.
    - **Why**: Monitoring ensures you can quickly respond to errors or performance issues in the production environment.

---

### **Summary of Technology Stack**

- **Frontend**: Angular (JWT authentication, user portal)
- **Backend (Business Logic)**: Laravel (REST API for product/order management, tax calculation, Square API)
- **Database**:
  - **DynamoDB**: User registration and approval status
  - **MySQL**: Orders, products, and other relational data
- **Admin Panel**: PHPRunner (to manage users, orders, and approvals)
- **Payment Gateway**: Square API (for payment processing)
- **Serverless Compute**: AWS Lambda (user registration, order confirmation)
- **Orchestration**: AWS Step Functions (coordinate payment and order notifications)
- **Email Notifications**: AWS SES or Laravel Mail

This plan ensures that we set up a solid infrastructure early on, with a focus on core user and product management before adding payment and business logic layers. Each phase builds upon the previous one to ensure smooth integration between all components.
