I am proposing a hybrid approach that leverages **AWS** for serverless infrastructure while keeping the core business logic on a more traditional **Laravel PHP/MySQL** backend. This allows you to take advantage of both the cost efficiency and scalability of serverless functions while maintaining robust control over certain backend logic through Laravel. Here's a detailed breakdown of my plan and some thoughts on each point:

### Detailed Breakdown and Thoughts

1. **Use AWS DynamoDB for User Registration Data**

   - **Why it works**: DynamoDB is cost-effective for handling user registrations. It's a NoSQL database that scales seamlessly and requires minimal setup. Using it for storing registration data will keep your costs low and operations fast.

2. **Serverless AWS Lambda to Connect to DynamoDB through AWS API Gateway**

   - **Why it's great**: This setup will enable a fully serverless interaction between your frontend and DynamoDB via **AWS API Gateway**, reducing hosting costs and the need for a traditional server. You can use **AWS Lambda** to verify registration, login, and issue JWT tokens efficiently.

3. **JWT Issued by Lambda at Login**

   - **How it works**: The Lambda function will handle login by verifying user data in DynamoDB and issuing a **JWT** upon successful authentication. This JWT will be passed to the Angular frontend and stored in the client (local storage or session storage) along with user information for session management.

4. **Store JWT in Angular Service**

   - **Why it fits**: Storing JWT in a service in Angular is a great approach to track the user’s login status and handle secure API calls. Angular's services make it easy to share state between components, and the JWT will authenticate further requests to your APIs.

5. **REST API with Laravel and PHP on HostGator**

   - **Why it's robust**: Laravel is an excellent choice for building your backend business logic. Hosting it on HostGator will save on costs compared to AWS, and Laravel provides a rich ecosystem to easily manage your MySQL database and APIs. This allows for greater flexibility and customization for checkout logic and other back-end functions.

6. **MySQL for Backend with Complex Queries**

   - **Why it's solid**: Using MySQL is a good choice for handling complex queries and transactions, especially when integrated with Laravel. MySQL’s relational database model is perfect for storing product, order, and user data, while DynamoDB is well-suited for fast access to more simplistic data like user sessions and preferences.

7. **Checkout Logic in Laravel API**

   - **Why it works**: You’re keeping critical checkout logic on the backend in Laravel, which allows for advanced price calculations, discounts, tax exemptions, etc. The final price will be calculated here and sent to the frontend before payment processing.

8. **Square API for Payment Approval & AWS Lambda for Final Charge**

   - **Flow**:
     - **Square API**: This will handle the initial authorization and temporary code generation.
     - **AWS Step Functions (State Machine)**: After the temporary code is generated, AWS Lambda within a **State Machine** can finalize the payment, charge the customer, and send the confirmation back to your Laravel API.
   - **Why it's powerful**: This setup ensures that payments are handled securely and scalably, with the state machine making sure every step is executed properly before the final confirmation is sent back to Laravel and the user.

9. **Admin & User Notification of New Orders**

   - **AWS Lambda State Machine & Email**: The Lambda State Machine can trigger an email notification once an order is confirmed. The email logic can either be handled via **AWS SES** (Simple Email Service) or using PHP mail function as you’ve proposed. Both methods are reliable for sending notifications to both users and admins.

10. **Lambdas in Boto3 (Python) or Node.js for State Machine**

- **Why it fits**: Using **Boto3 (Python)** or **Node.js** in AWS Lambda functions works perfectly for executing the different steps of the payment, order confirmation, and notification process in the state machine. Both are well-supported and flexible in AWS Lambda environments.

11. **User Access to Order Information via Laravel API**

- **Why it works**: Laravel can handle the user’s order history securely. After login, the user will access their order history via the Laravel API, which retrieves the necessary information from MySQL. This maintains separation between user data and ensures security.

12. **Admin Portal with PHPRunner Development**

- **Why it's useful**: Using **PHPRunner** for the admin portal is a smart way to rapidly develop the back-office system where admins can manage orders, users, and other backend tasks. PHPRunner helps speed up development for CRUD-based admin panels.

13. **User Profile with Registration Form**

- **Why it's necessary**: Including a registration form in the user profile lets users input personal and business information, streamlining the approval process. It ensures that you capture all necessary data for business users, which is critical for tax exemption and order processing.

14. **Business Information Prompt After Login**

- **Why it helps**: Prompting users to enter business information for approval if it hasn’t already been entered ensures a smooth user experience. This also ensures that business users are correctly flagged for tax exemptions.

15. **Admin Ability to Inactivate Users**

- **Why it’s smart**: Giving admins the ability to deactivate users directly through the admin portal ensures better control over user accounts, preventing unauthorized access or usage.

16. **Contact Us Form in MySQL**

- **Why it’s practical**: This makes sense as it allows both registered and unregistered users to submit inquiries or feedback. Storing this data in MySQL helps you keep all communication history in a structured way and provides easy retrieval for admins.

### Technologies & Flow Summary:

- **Frontend**: Angular 17
- **Serverless Infrastructure**:
  - **AWS Lambda** (Python or Node.js for serverless functions)
  - **DynamoDB** (user registration and login data)
  - **API Gateway** (interface to connect AWS services with Angular)
  - **AWS Step Functions** (manage payment flows and order finalization)
  - **AWS SES** or **PHP mail** (email notifications)
- **Backend**: Laravel with PHP/MySQL (business logic, advanced queries, user profiles, orders)
- **Payment**: **Square API** (initial approval) + AWS Lambda for final payment execution
- **Admin Portal**: Developed with **PHPRunner** for quick deployment of management tools

### Advantages of this Approach:

- **Cost-Effective**: By utilizing AWS Lambda and DynamoDB for specific functions and relying on HostGator for hosting the Laravel backend, you reduce costs significantly while still taking advantage of cloud scalability.
- **Scalability**: Using serverless functions (AWS Lambda) makes scaling your app very easy. You’ll only pay for what you use.
- **Security**: JWT for user authentication keeps things secure, while Laravel will handle user data safely in MySQL. Sensitive operations like payments are processed using a combination of Square API and secure AWS Lambda workflows.
- **Separation of Concerns**: By keeping logic like payment handling and notification in AWS and the main backend in Laravel, you ensure modularity and robustness.
- **Efficiency**: AWS State Machines will efficiently handle complex workflows like payment finalization, email notifications, and order confirmations.

### Next Steps:

1. **Setup DynamoDB**: Create tables for user registration data.
2. **Build AWS Lambda**: Start with the user registration and login logic.
3. **Create Laravel APIs**: Set up your REST API for product listings, checkout logic, and user profiles.
4. **Integrate Square API**: Set up the payment flow and handle approval via the API.
5. **Implement AWS State Machine**: For finalizing payments, sending emails, and confirming orders.
6. **Develop Angular Frontend**: Create the UI components for login, registration, product listing, checkout, etc.
