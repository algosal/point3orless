For building the Angular application for **Point3OrLess**, we can break down the required components and features into a structured plan. Here's a detailed approach:

### 1. Project Structure

We'll organize the application into different components and services, ensuring that each functionality is properly encapsulated. Here's a high-level structure for the app:

```
src/
  app/
    components/
      home/
      products/
      contact-us/
      registration/
      age-verification-modal/
    services/
      auth.service.ts
      user.service.ts
  assets/
  environments/
  app.module.ts
  app-routing.module.ts
```

### 2. Application Requirements

#### 2.1 **First Page (Home Page) with Age Verification Modal**

**Component**: `HomeComponent`

- This will be the landing page of the application.
- **Age Verification Modal** will ask two questions:
  - "Are you 21 or over 21 years old?" (Yes/No)
  - "Are you a Business or an Individual?" (Business/Individual)
  - **Routing**:
    - If under 21, display an error message and block access.
    - If "Individual", route to `https://point3orbelow.com`.
    - If "Business", route to the `ProductComponent`.

**Additional Considerations**:

- Modal should only appear the first time the user visits, with consent stored in `localStorage`.
- Business users will proceed to the product list if they meet the age requirements.

#### 2.2 **Product List Component**

**Component**: `ProductComponent`

- Displays a list of available products for wholesale purchase.
- Minimum purchase amount is $3,000.
- Approved users will not be charged tax, while unapproved users will be charged tax (details handled in the service layer).

**Additional Considerations**:

- We'll show wholesale pricing and other business-related details.

#### 2.3 **Contact Us Page**

**Component**: `ContactUsComponent`

- Contains a form for users to submit inquiries.
- Basic form fields like `Name`, `Email`, `Subject`, and `Message`.
- Optionally, include phone number and address.

#### 2.4 **Registration Page**

**Component**: `RegistrationComponent`

- Allows users to register as a business.
- **Form Fields**:
  - Business Name, Business Email, Password, Phone Number.
  - Business License/Certification Upload (for approval process).
- After successful registration, the user will be routed to the product page once approved by the admin.
- Integration with a backend service (or API) to handle registration.

#### 2.5 **Auth & Approval State Management**

**Service**: `AuthService`

- Handles login and registration logic.
- Keeps track of the user’s login status and approval state.

**Service**: `UserService`

- Provides business logic to check if a user is approved for purchasing (approval state fetched from backend).
- The service will determine if the user will be charged tax based on their approval status.

### 3. Additional Functionalities & Business Logic

#### 3.1 **Tax Calculation**

- **Service**: `PaymentService` (could be an existing or new service).
- Logic to determine tax:
  - If the user is approved: no tax is charged.
  - If the user is not approved: tax is added to the total.
- This logic will be embedded in the checkout process, where tax is calculated and displayed based on the approval state.

#### 3.2 **Minimum Purchase Amount**

- A validation on the checkout process to ensure the user’s total is $3,000 or above.
- Display an error message if the total is less than $3,000, preventing the user from proceeding.

### 4. Routing Structure

We'll define the routes for navigation across the app.

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: "", component: HomeComponent },
  { path: "products", component: ProductComponent },
  { path: "contact-us", component: ContactUsComponent },
  { path: "register", component: RegistrationComponent },
  // Route for redirection if user is not a business
  { path: "**", redirectTo: "" },
];
```

### 5. Professional Features & Considerations

#### 5.1 **Mobile Responsiveness**

- Ensure the app is fully responsive and optimized for mobile users.

#### 5.2 **Error Handling**

- Proper error handling for user actions, including form validation errors, login failures, and registration issues.

#### 5.3 **User Feedback**

- Provide clear feedback for actions such as successful form submissions or errors.
- Loading indicators for longer actions like registration or login.

#### 5.4 **Testing**

- Unit testing for each component to ensure functionality.
- End-to-end (E2E) tests for major user journeys like registration, login, and purchase.

#### 5.5 **Security Considerations**

- Secure user data by integrating authentication and authorization, potentially using JWT (JSON Web Token) for session management.

### Next Steps

Let's break down the process:

1. **Initial Setup**: Set up Angular project, routing, and basic structure.
2. **Age Verification & Routing**: Implement the modal and routing based on age and business/individual status.
3. **Product Page**: Build the product list with the minimum purchase amount and tax calculation logic.
4. **Contact Us**: Build the contact form.
5. **Registration**: Build the registration component with approval flow.
6. **Auth Service**: Implement login, registration, and approval state management.
